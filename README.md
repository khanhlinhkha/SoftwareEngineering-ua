# Software Engineering and Architecture – Assignment Collection (2023–2024)

This repository contains all **12 individual assignments** completed as part of the **Software Engineering and Architecture** course at the **University of Antwerp**.

## Course Focus

While Java is used as the primary programming language, the true focus of the course lies in **designing and building large-scale, complex software systems** using core principles of software architecture, engineering patterns, and modular development.

## Repository Structure

Each assignment builds on key course concepts and tools such as Java, Maven, Git, and Bitbucket.

> All assignments were developed and submitted individually, with support during bi-weekly exercise seminars. Each was evaluated as part of continuous assessment.

## Setup Instructions
